# spoonsaver

A magnet holder to print out in TPU, that fits in the throat of a sink's garbage disposal. When a metal utensil tries to fall into the disposal, the strong magnets grab it and save it from a horrible fate! To remove the caught silverware, simply pull it off the magnets.

This model is designed to fit in 3.25" diameter disposals. Usually disposals manufactured by InSinkErator, Kohler, Moen, and Emerson have that size of opening.

### How to Assemble

Print out the model at printables: https://www.printables.com/model/451064-spoon-saver in TPU for flexibility. I used overture TPU off of amazon: [Overture TPU filament](https://www.amazon.com/Overture-Filament-Flexible-Consumables-Dimensional/dp/B07VDP2S3P/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4%3Aamzn1.sym.eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4&cv_ct_cx=overture%2Btpu%2Bfilament&keywords=overture%2Btpu%2Bfilament&pd_rd_i=B07VDP2S3P&pd_rd_r=2fa95b95-a110-46af-a547-bcfe784d566b&pd_rd_w=Cj4xE&pd_rd_wg=wJM8p&pf_rd_p=eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4&pf_rd_r=CWP4S51Q6K7NAVC69XST&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-1-5985efba-8948-4f09-9122-d605505c9d1e&th=1)

Insert 12 20x10x5 mm rectangular neodymium magents into the holder by sliding them into the bottom through the tiny rectangular holes. I got mine off of amazon: [20x10x5mm rectangular magnets](https://www.amazon.com/MIN-CI-Neodymium-Refrigerator-Industrial/dp/B09LYBBQDL/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=20x10x5mm%2Bneodymium%2Bmagnets&sr=8-1&th=1)

### How to Use

Find the lip at the bottom of the holder, that is the end that goes in first. It will slide into the throat of the disposal and that lip will set into the groove at the bottom of the disposal throat.

Slide the magnet holder into the throat of the disposal until the bottom snaps into the groove.

### Troubleshooting

If you can see the bottoms of the magnets after putting it in, you put it in wrong. Flip it over and put it lip edge down.
